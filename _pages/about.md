I'm a doctor in the Psychology of Wellbeing.
👨🏻‍💻 I'm doing a hybrid national Ph.D.: Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence for Society (University of Pisa) applied to psychotechnology. Specifically, my work focuses on the predictive analysis of psychological markers of cognitive impairment in the elderly through VR assessments.
