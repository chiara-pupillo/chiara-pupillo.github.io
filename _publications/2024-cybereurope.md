title: "Detecting Cognitive Flexibility Deficits in Aging: A Novel Approach Using Virtual Reality And Artificial Intelligence"
collection: publications 
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2024-cybereurope
excerpt: 'My PhD project proposes a novel methodology for the early detection of cognitive flexibility deficits in aging populations. By leveraging virtual reality, machine learning models, and semantic network analysis, the project aims to develop a more sensitive and ecologically valid assessment of cognitive flexibility. The integration of these techniques offers potential for identifying subtle cognitive deficits that may precede traditional neuropsychological assessments.'

My PhD project proposes a novel methodology for the early detection of cognitive flexibility deficits in aging populations. By leveraging virtual reality, machine learning models, and semantic network analysis, the project aims to develop a more sensitive and ecologically valid assessment of cognitive flexibility. The integration of these techniques offers potential for identifying subtle cognitive deficits that may precede traditional neuropsychological assessments.
